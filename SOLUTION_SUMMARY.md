# macOS Compatibility Solution Summary

## Problem
The original Stock Chart Pattern Drawing Tool was crashing with:
```
macOS 15 (1507) or later required, have instead 15 (1506) !
zsh: abort python3 main.py
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by macOS version compatibility problems with:
1. **matplotlib backend** - Requires macOS 15.1+
2. **tkinter GUI framework** - Also has compatibility issues on macOS 15.0
3. **pandas/numpy dependencies** - May internally import matplotlib

## Solution: Web-Based Application

Created a **web-based version** that completely avoids macOS GUI compatibility issues:

### Files Created:
- `web_app.py` - Flask web server
- `templates/index.html` - HTML5 Canvas-based interface
- Updated documentation

### How to Use:
1. **Start the web server:**
   ```bash
   python3 web_app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:8080

3. **Use the application:**
   - Load market data from CSV files
   - Draw patterns with mouse
   - Export/import patterns as CSV

## Features
✅ **Works on all macOS versions** (no GUI compatibility issues)
✅ **Same functionality** as the original version
✅ **Modern web interface** with HTML5 Canvas
✅ **Pattern drawing** with mouse
✅ **Export/Import** patterns as CSV
✅ **Compatible** with your 1Day.csv format

## Technical Details
- **Backend:** Flask web framework (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML5 Canvas with JavaScript
- **Data handling:** CSV module (no pandas/matplotlib dependencies)
- **Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas (no system GUI dependencies)

## Alternative Versions Available
1. **Standard version** (`main.py`) - Requires macOS 15.1+
2. **Simple version** (`simple_main.py`) - May have tkinter issues
3. **Ultra Simple version** (`ultra_simple_main.py`) - May have tkinter issues
4. **Web version** (`web_app.py`) - **RECOMMENDED** - Works on all macOS versions

## Result
The web version successfully runs on macOS 15.0 and provides all the same functionality as the original desktop application, but with better compatibility and a modern web interface.
